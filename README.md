# Press Play ðŸŽ®

**Press Play** is a retro game recommendation tool that helps users discover video games similar to the ones they already love.

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works
We analyze retro game data and compare attributes like:
- Publisher
- Genre
- ESRB Rating
- Online Play Support
- Average Play Time

We use **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort** to sort the games and benchmark their performance.
